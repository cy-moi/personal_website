Some piece of writing I retrieved from my abandoned evernotes account. LOL, I'm not that into AI algorithms though right now, but it looks like AI has mattered a big deal to me at some point in the past.

I first picked up the idea of dedicating myself to artificial intelligence development from reading and watching sci-fi. Though a millennium, I grew up with old double feature films, which soon lured me into 30s Golden Age Hollywood. With enthusiasm for science and narratives, I loved to let my imagination express itself relentlessly and write my own stories, jumping from time to time in some 22nd century, integrating models and lines of codes into adventures, connecting dots, and making sense out of fantasies.

But scientific breakthroughs are not just thinking out of the box; I have to concentrate and look into the box first.

Therefore, during my high school years, I ran my passion stream down to a binary filter, split it into two containers, one engineering, one philosophical. As we all know, computer science is a milestone in recreating human intelligence. It explores the implementation and tackles technical hardships, and so in line with the engineering layer. Cognitive science, however, would fall in the philosophical dimension. Leaning to which direction is never my concern, I am very well aware of how this field relies on co-operation.

Reverse-Engineer the Brain is the most important to me.

“AI empowers humanity.”

The slogan is everywhere. But how?

Machines make predictions from previous data points, just like handling situations based on my past experiences, and neural networks combine all the weights, feed losses back, correct themselves, and evolve, just like we reflect on ourselves after making mistakes. However, such fundamental emulation never surpasses the creator: statistics can lead to biases, discrimination of outliers, and unreasonable confidence level, amplifying human blind sights. I have learned classifications, regressions, models, and tools, useful, but hardly insightful. How can we empower humanity with artificial intelligence if our own intelligence remains a black box?

We must understand how the human mind works. Reading Foucault's' The Order of Things, surprisingly, I realized the development of AI actually follows humans' same philosophical path: symbols, logic, classification, connectionism, generation from existing symbols, etc. Finally, I understand Artificial Intelligence is not about machines but us, our cognitive status, and how our brain and cognitive abilities work together to make sense of the world surrounding us and reconcile “Being vs. Becoming.” Either flesh or mechanics, the carrier of intelligence is but a sensor provider, which has to transport perceptions along the road of neurons to the brain. Nothing matters to me more.
