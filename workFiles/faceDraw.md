# Face Doodle

This one is inspired by one of the official mediapipe and tfjs demos: [scroobly](https://scroobly.com/) made by Shan Huang. After I made an AR demo which allow users to add custom stickes following their faces, I think it is really fun to try this out. So I did.

To get rid of all the preprocesses, I allow users to draw lively "on the video stream." I have also added "color picker,""undo" and "clear" functions later.
