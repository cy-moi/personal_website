# Goose Laser Eye

I am so into memes, so I made this demo to have a pair of laser eyes just as the goose meme (maybe a dead meme now). The technology is nothing new, the same tfjs and the same mediapipe model. I used the face normal as eye sight direction and calculate its projection onto the canvas as the ultimate laser lines. I have my fun, :).

For the video demo, I still need some time to mask my face out from it for privacy concerns.
